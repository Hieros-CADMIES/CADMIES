# Testing the IPLD Knowledge System: A Complete Beginner's Guide

## 🎯 Who This Guide Is For
- **Students** learning about technology
- **Teachers** who want to demonstrate content addressing
- **Researchers** exploring knowledge systems
- **Anyone** with basic computer skills

**No programming experience needed!**

## 📋 What You'll Need

### Hardware Requirements:
- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Internet connection (to download tools)
- About 50MB of free space

### Software Requirements:
1. **Python** (we'll install it if you don't have it)
2. **Command Line/Terminal** (comes with your computer)

**Don't worry if these sound technical - we'll guide you through everything!**

## 🚀 PART 1: Setting Up Your Computer

### Step 1: Open Your Command Line/Terminal

#### On Windows:
1. Press the `Windows Key` (between Ctrl and Alt)
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter
3. A black window appears - this is your Command Prompt

#### On Mac:
1. Press `Command + Space` (hold both keys)
2. Type "Terminal" and press Enter
3. A white/gray window appears - this is your Terminal

#### On Linux:
1. Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` (all three together)
2. A terminal window appears

---

### Step 2: Check if Python is Installed

In your terminal/command line, type this **exactly** and press Enter:
```bash
python --version

What should happen:

✅ Good outcome: You see something like:
text

Python 3.8.10

or
text

Python 3.10.0

If you see this: ✅ You have Python! Skip to Step 4.

❌ Bad outcome: You see:

    Python 2.7.18 (too old)

    'python' is not recognized...

    command not found

If you see this: ❌ You need to install Python. Go to Step 3.
Step 3: Install Python (If Needed)
For Windows:

    Open your web browser

    Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/

    Click the big yellow "Download Python 3.12" button

    Run the downloaded file

    IMPORTANT: Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"

    Click "Install Now"

    Wait for installation to finish

    Close and reopen your Command Prompt

For Mac:

    Open your web browser

    Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/

    Download "Python 3.12" for macOS

    Run the downloaded file

    Follow the installation steps

    Close and reopen your Terminal

For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

In your terminal, type:
bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

After installing: Go back to Step 2 to verify Python is installed.
Step 4: Install Required Packages

In your terminal/command line, type this exactly and press Enter:
bash

pip install dag-cbor multiformats

What should happen:
You'll see text scrolling as packages download. It should end with:
text

Successfully installed dag-cbor-X.X multiformats-X.X

If you get an error:
Try this instead:
bash

python -m pip install dag-cbor multiformats

🚀 PART 2: Download and Test the Tools
Step 5: Download the Tools

In your terminal/command line, type this exactly and press Enter:
bash

git clone https://github.com/Hieros-CADMIES/CADMIES.git

What should happen:
You'll see something like:
text

Cloning into 'CADMIES'...
remote: Enumerating objects: XX, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (XX/XX), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (XX/XX), done.
remote: Total XX (delta XX), reused XX (delta XX), pack-reused XX
Receiving objects: 100% (XX/XX), XX KiB | XX KiB/s, done.

If you get an error about "git not found":

    Download from: https://github.com/Hieros-CADMIES/CADMIES/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

    Extract the ZIP file

    Open the extracted folder

Step 6: Enter the Tools Folder

In your terminal/command line, type this exactly and press Enter:
bash

cd CADMIES

What should happen:
You're now inside the tools folder. You can type dir (Windows) or ls (Mac/Linux) to see the files.
🚀 PART 3: Your First Test
Step 7: Run the CID Generator

In your terminal/command line, type this exactly and press Enter:
bash

python cid_generator_v1.1.0.py

What should happen:
You'll see a lot of text scrolling. Look for this line (it might be near the bottom):
text

🎯 Generated CID: bafyreifh5f5i6elunhcqfuw7n2t3c2rl4z6jtv76rz4wm2kz2q7bj7gnji

IMPORTANT: Your CID might be different! That's okay! Just look for a line starting with 🎯 Generated CID: followed by a long string of letters and numbers.
Step 8: Copy Your CID

Find the line that says 🎯 Generated CID: and copy the long string after it.

Example of what to copy:
text

bafyreifh5f5i6elunhcqfuw7n2t3c2rl4z6jtv76rz4wm2kz2q7bj7gnji

How to copy:

    Click and drag your mouse to select the entire CID string

    Right-click and choose "Copy"

    Or press Ctrl+C (Windows) or Command+C (Mac)

Step 9: Test the CBOR Reader

In your terminal/command line, type this exactly (replace with YOUR CID):
bash

python cbor_reader.py bafyreifh5f5i6elunhcqfuw7n2t3c2rl4jbrdkjlfh5lhlkjh3jkh6lkjsdf

But wait! Replace the example CID with your actual CID that you copied.

Example:
If your CID was bafyreifh5f5i6elunhcqfuw7n2t3c2rl4z6jtv76rz4wm2kz2q7bj7gnji, type:
bash

python cbor_reader.py bafyreifh5f5i6elunhcqfuw7n2t3c2rl4z6jtv76rz4wm2kz2q7bj7gnji

What should happen:
You'll see a nicely formatted display showing information about the "Law of Conservation of Energy."
Step 10: Test Again (Verify Determinism)

In your terminal/command line, type this exactly and press Enter:
bash

python cid_generator_v1.1.0.py

Look for the CID line again:
text

🎯 Generated CID: bafyreifh5f5i6elunhcqfuw7n2t3c2rl4z6jtv76rz4wm2kz2q7bj7gnji

IMPORTANT CHECK:
Is this CID exactly the same as the first one?

✅ YES - Same CID: Perfect! The system works correctly.
❌ NO - Different CID: Something is wrong. Try the troubleshooting steps below.
🎉 CONGRATULATIONS!

You've successfully:

    ✅ Set up Python on your computer

    ✅ Installed the required packages

    ✅ Downloaded the IPLD knowledge tools

    ✅ Created your first content-addressed identifier (CID)

    ✅ Retrieved knowledge using that CID

    ✅ Verified the system is deterministic (same content → same CID)

You now have a working content-addressed knowledge system!
📁 What Was Created?

The system created three folders on your computer:
Check what was created:

In your terminal/command line, type:

On Windows:
bash

dir

On Mac/Linux:
bash

ls -la

You should see:
text

blocks/    (Contains the encoded knowledge)
index/     (Contains the human-readable index)
logs/      (Contains operation history)

🧪 Additional Tests You Can Try
Test A: List All Stored Concepts
bash

python cbor_reader.py --list

Test B: Try the Human-Readable ID
bash

python cbor_reader.py Physics:Law/ConservationOfEnergy

Test C: Create Your Own Concept

    Open Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac)

    Copy this text:

json

{
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",
  "human_id": "my_test_concept",
  "title": "My First Test",
  "definition": "This is my first knowledge concept",
  "type": "Test",
  "domain": "Testing",
  "metadata": {
    "created": "2026-01-08T10:00:00Z",
    "creator": "Me",
    "certainty_score": 0.8,
    "version": 1,
    "purpose": "testing"
  }
}

    Save it as my_test.json in the CADMIES folder

    In your terminal:

bash

python cid_generator_v1.1.0.py --concept-file my_test.json
python cbor_reader.py my_test_concept

🐛 Troubleshooting Guide
Problem 1: "python not found"

Solution: Python isn't in your PATH. Try:
bash

python3 --version

If that works, use python3 instead of python in all commands.
Problem 2: "pip not found"

Solution: Try:
bash

python -m pip install dag-cbor multiformats

Problem 3: Different CIDs each time

Solution: This is serious! The system must be deterministic. Check:

    Are you running the exact same command?

    Did any files change?

    Try restarting and running just the basic test again.

Problem 4: "Module not found: dag_cbor"

Solution: The installation failed. Try:
bash

pip uninstall dag-cbor multiformats
pip install dag-cbor multiformats --upgrade

Problem 5: Permission errors

Solution: On Mac/Linux, try:
bash

sudo pip install dag-cbor multiformats

📊 Success Checklist

    Opened terminal/command line

    Verified Python 3.8+ is installed

    Installed dag-cbor and multiformats

    Downloaded the CADMIES tools

    Ran python cid_generator_v1.1.0.py

    Found and copied the CID

    Ran python cbor_reader.py [YOUR_CID]

    Saw the knowledge display

    Verified same CID on second run

If you checked all boxes, you've successfully tested the system!
💡 What You Just Demonstrated

    Content Addressing: Knowledge gets a permanent address based on its content

    Determinism: Same content → Same address every time

    Verifiability: Anyone with the CID can verify they have the exact same content

    Local Storage: Everything stays on your computer - no cloud needed

This is how trustworthy knowledge systems work!

"The same understanding should always have the same address."
