# Phase 72: LLMDataHub Fork Reorganization

## What Changed

The abandoned LLMDataHub repository (original: Zjh-819/LLMDataHub, 3.5K+ stars, last updated ~2023) was forked to Project-Hierion/LLMDataHub and reorganized for ongoing community maintenance. The single-page README containing all dataset tables was split into three purpose-built pages with alphabetized listings, newest-first ordering, and a skeleton for future description revisions. A pull request was opened to the original repository offering the improvements back to the community.

## Why

LLMDataHub provided useful dataset resources during CADMIES development (identified in Session 033, assessed in Session 038). The repository was abandoned — 235 forks with zero contributions back. The roadmap entry from July 19 stated: "The mycelium reclaims nutrients from fallen logs." This phase executes on that commitment by organizing the fork for maintainability and offering the improvements upstream. It serves double duty: training material discovery for Dr. Mistral and a real-world contribution to the open-source LLM community.

## Changes Made

### README.md Reorganization
- Slimmed to a landing page preserving original intro, description, and structure overview
- Removed inline dataset tables, replaced with link to DATASETS.md
- Updated badge links to point to Project-Hierion fork
- Added fork attribution footer with gratitude to community and original author Junhao Zhao
- Added Project Hierion contact email (project-hierion@proton.me)
- Contact section clearly separates original authors from fork maintainers

### DATASETS.md Creation
- All dataset tables extracted from original README into dedicated page
- Datasets alphabetized within each section
- General Alignment section ordered newest-first (November 2023 → Before June 2023)
- Table of contents with anchor links to all sections
- Original descriptions preserved verbatim
- Page header mirrors README for visual consistency

### REVISED-DESCRIPTIONS.md Creation
- Skeleton page with placeholder entries for every dataset
- Structure matches DATASETS.md exactly (same sections, same order)
- Each entry preserves original description and includes *(pending)* revision slot
- Ready for future description updates using `[📝 click here for the revised (dataset name) description]` link format

### Pull Request
- Opened PR from Project-Hierion/LLMDataHub to Zjh-819/LLMDataHub
- Friendly, respectful message with clear attribution
- If accepted: improvements flow back to 3.5K+ stargazers
- If not: Project-Hierion fork remains the maintained version for those who find it

## Testing

Manual review of all three pages for formatting consistency, link validity, and content preservation. All original dataset entries verified present and intact. Table of contents anchor links tested. No automation failures — repository does not use CADMIES vault tooling.

## Results

Three clean, friendly, informative pages replacing one cluttered README. All original content preserved. Structure in place for ongoing maintenance — new datasets can be added to DATASETS.md, revised descriptions to REVISED-DESCRIPTIONS.md, without touching the README landing page.

## Analysis

The original repository followed the common academic pattern: publish during active research, graduate, abandon. The 235 forks represent bookmarks, not contributions. By organizing the fork and opening a PR, Project Hierion becomes the first fork to offer improvements back. Whether or not the PR is accepted, the maintained fork exists for the community.

The three-page structure separates concerns cleanly: discovery (README), reference (DATASETS.md), and curation (REVISED-DESCRIPTIONS.md). This makes each page maintainable independently and keeps the README welcoming rather than overwhelming.

## Conclusion

The structural reorganization is complete. Ongoing work includes revising dataset descriptions, adding 2024-2026 datasets, checking for dead links, and monitoring PR status. The mycelium has reclaimed nutrients from a fallen log and offered them back to the forest.
