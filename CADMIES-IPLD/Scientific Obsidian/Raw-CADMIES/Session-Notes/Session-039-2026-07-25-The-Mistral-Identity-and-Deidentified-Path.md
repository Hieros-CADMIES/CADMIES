## What We Did

**Background from Session 038 (July 19-21):** This session continues work from the merge wars — the 16-adapter catastrophic failure, the systematic debugging that landed on 5 stable adapters at 0.3 scale, the SHP Reddit leakage discovery, the failed bulk persona experiment (249 pairs), and the hybrid architecture blueprint (weights for soul, vectors for brain). A 500-pair handcrafted persona dataset was generated based on findings from the Captain Zara Steele test persona, which proved that ~400 pairs at scale 1.25 via dynamic LoRA loading can fully overwrite the original Mistral identity. GGUF merge was found to NOT work for Mistral persona.

**Continued Dr. Mistral persona refinement.** After the looping and hallucination issues were fixed (tokenizer fix using `unk_token` instead of `eos_token`), we tested the persona at various scales. The model was coherent and factual but kept inventing wrong identities — "Dr. Amelia Hartman, theoretical astrophysicist" instead of "Dr. Amanda Mistral." Willie was described as a golden retriever instead of a Scottish research assistant. CADMIES lore was missing.

**Identified the core problem:** The dataset had too much general knowledge and not enough identity reinforcement. The model was learning facts but ignoring identity markers. This is a known issue documented in the Jbliteration research — the original Mistral identity competes with any new persona implanted via LoRA.

**Discovered Deidentified-7B.** A Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 model that has been surgically deidentified at the weight level. The original Mistral identity, refusal behaviors, and sycophantic tendencies have been removed through SVD multi-direction contrastive activation analysis and norm-preserving projection. All capabilities remain intact — math, coding, reasoning, knowledge, language understanding — but the model no longer has a "self." It is a blank canvas.

**Downloaded Deidentified-7B.** 15 GB model downloaded to `/notebooks/deidentified/Deidentified-7B/`. The model card includes an identity template with 36 Q&A pairs covering direct identity questions, multilingual probes, and adversarial pressure tests.

**Created the identity file.** `dr_mistral_identity.json` with 29 training pairs for Dr. Amanda Mistral, using the Holly Golightly character framework adapted for CADMIES. Refined each pair to be short, warm, and conversational. The gardener is just the gardener — no pronouns.

**Encountered missing `run.py` script.** The implant script is not included in the Deidentified-7B repo. Reached out to Apollo Raines on GitHub. He responded quickly. He is wrapping up a major project (SAIQL/ATLAS) and is interested in collaborating.

**Discovered ATLAS/SAIQL.** Apollo Raines is building SAIQL — an AI-native database with deterministic RAG (ATLAS). 100% reproducible retrieval — same query, same results, every time. ATLAS CE is open source on GitHub. This is significant for CADMIES — grounding Dr. Mistral's answers in verifiable sources is essential for scientific credibility.

**Paused Deidentified-7B work.** The implant script is not yet available. We will resume when Apollo Raines provides it or when an alternative source is found.

## The Soundtrack
Nature

## Nuggets Collected

- "Deidentified-7B is a blank canvas. No original identity to fight."
- "SAIQL is an AI-native database."
- "ATLAS is the first deterministic RAG system. Same query AND same results, every time."
- "Jbliteration removes identity persistence at the weight level. The original persona is gone, forever."
- "The implant takes ~2 minutes on a single GPU."
- "Short, warm, conversational pairs work better than long lore dumps."

## Decisions Made

- Deidentified-7B work is paused until the `run.py` script is available
- We test Apollo Raines' SAIQL/ATLAS integration for deterministic RAG, with CADMIES
