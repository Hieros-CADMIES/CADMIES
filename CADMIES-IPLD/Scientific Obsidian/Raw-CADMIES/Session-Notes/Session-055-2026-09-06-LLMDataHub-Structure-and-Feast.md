# Session 055 — 2026-09-06 — LLMDataHub Structure and Feast

## Soundtrack
Amyttiville movies. Mycelium reclaiming nutrients from fallen logs. Good weed. Good herb. Good nature.

## What We Did

**Phase 1: Partnership Structure & Yellow Pages Architecture**
- Created AWESOME-LISTS.md — dedicated page for curated lists
- Created PLATFORMS.md — dedicated page for infrastructure platforms
- Created INTRO.md — preserved original README content
- Updated README.md with partnership structure, separated original authors from branch maintainers
- Added collapsible sections to all pages (DATASETS.md, MODELS.md, PAPERS.md, TOOLS.md, AWESOME-LISTS.md, PLATFORMS.md)
- Added "Repo Automation Status" badge to all pages
- Added instruction note for users to click arrows to expand sections

**Phase 2: The Feast**
- Added mlabonne/llm-datasets (4.8k ★) to AWESOME-LISTS.md
- Added mlabonne/llm-course (82k+ ★) to AWESOME-LISTS.md
- Added mlabonne/llm-tools to TOOLS.md
- Added mlabonne's models to MODELS.md
- Added specific datasets from llm-datasets to DATASETS.md
- Added EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness (5k+ ★) to AWESOME-LISTS.md
- Added lm-sys/FastChat (30k+ ★) to AWESOME-LISTS.md

**Phase 3: Merge & Polish**
- Fixed duplicate entries in AWESOME-LISTS.md
- Added missing placeholders to REVISED-DESCRIPTIONS.md
- Added Repo Automation Status badge to REVISED-DESCRIPTIONS.md
- Merged feature/awesome-lists-and-keywords into main
- Resolved merge conflicts (DATASETS.md, TOOLS.md, logs)
- Renamed validate_vault.py → validate-autonomy.py and updated references
- Ran final validator: 0 issues, vault is clean

## What Worked

The Yellow Pages architecture is clean and scalable. Each page has the same structure, making it easy for users to navigate.

The mlabonne feast was incredibly productive — we absorbed an entire ecosystem of knowledge in one session.

The partnership structure clearly separates original authors from branch maintainers, giving credit where credit is due.

## What Broke

- Duplicate entries in AWESOME-LISTS.md (llm-tools appeared twice) — fixed by regenerating the file
- Missing placeholders in REVISED-DESCRIPTIONS.md for new dataset entries — added all missing placeholders
- Merge conflicts in DATASETS.md, TOOLS.md, and logs when merging feature branch — resolved by keeping our versions
- Validator was missing the Repo Automation Status badge — added it

## Decisions Made

- Original LLMDataHub authors (Junhao Zhao, Prof. Wanyun Cui) stay credited on every page
- Project Hierion is the maintainer, not the owner — partnership model
- Use 🤑 emoji for HF-hosted resources (Nvidia-owned)
- All pages get the Repo Automation Status badge
- Rename validate_vault.py → validate-autonomy.py — better name for our context
- Use collapsible sections for better navigation
- Add user instruction note for clickable arrows

## Nuggets Collected

- "Credit where credit is due. Gratitude where gratitude belongs."
- "The mycelium is stronger than it was yesterday."
- "The vault is clean. The mycelium is healthy."
- "We don't steal. We harvest. We are mycelium, not thieves."
- "160 commits is not a lot of code. It's a lot of care."
- "Today we ate well. Today we grew. Tomorrow we re-distribute the nutrients."
